# Quotient Space Inverses Solver
Taking a quotient space in the format of Z/mZ (Ex. Z/16Z), the Quotient Space Inverses Solver cleanly computes the unit group, and each unit's order and inverse.

## Web Interface
Try it online: [https://bolongtang.github.io/QuotientSpaceInversesSolver/](https://bolongtang.github.io/QuotientSpaceInversesSolver/)

The web interface uses Pyodide to run the Python solver directly in your browser, providing the same functionality as running the script in a regular shell.

## Command Line Usage
You can also run the solver from the command line:

```bash
python QuotientSpaceInversesSolver.py
```

Then enter your quotient space in the format `Z/mZ` (e.g., `Z/16Z`).
